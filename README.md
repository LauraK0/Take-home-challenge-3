### Design Choices

#### Colour Palette:
Generated using https://colordesigner.io/color-palette-from-image. These are:
- orange - #F3911F
- beige - #F2EDE6

#### Font
It was difficult to match the font. The Roboto font family is a reasonable substitute.

## Task 2: Stop-watch

Create a HTML page with a functional stopwatch. 

#### User stories

The stopwatch must be accurate and have the following features:
- [x] Time display: The current elapsed time in the following format 00:00:00:00 (hours, minutes, seconds, centiseconds)
- [x] Start button: A button to start or continue a timer.
- [x] Pause button: A button to pause the running timer.
- [x] Reset button: A button to reset the timer to zero.

#### Stretch user stories

- [x] Lap button: A button to write the time to a list/table of laps (this would not pause the timer). The results should be shown on screen and still be visible if the page is refreshed.
- [x] Clear lap history button: A button to clear any lap history
- [x] Make it look good
- [x] No bugs or quirky behaviour
